# 📊 Risk Assessment Tool

A hybrid financial risk scoring engine that combines machine learning predictions with rule-based logic to assess client risk profiles in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Logistic regression model trained on financial indicators
- 🧠 Rule-based overrides for edge cases
- 🔀 Hybrid scoring engine with conflict resolution
- 🖥️ CLI interface for interactive scoring
- 📦 Modular project structure for easy extension

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Train model** on historical financial data
2. **Apply rules** for edge cases (e.g., excessive debt)
3. **Combine both** to produce a final risk decision
4. **Score clients** via CLI or notebook
